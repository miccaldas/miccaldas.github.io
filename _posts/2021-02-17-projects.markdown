I have a tendency to get interested in something and then, with
the same passion and resolve, promptly forget about it.  
For this not to happen, I started making lists of things I see
and want to try out.  
This is my current one.  
May the Gods of procrastination and sloth grant me the chance to
complete them all.  

1 - 'Data Science in the Command Line':  
**"This book is about doing data science at the command line.**
**Our aim is to make you a more efficient and productive**
**data scientist by teaching you how to leverage the power of**
**the command line."**  
I like the command line, I'm interested in data science ...
this is totally my jam!  
Off course, I have no idea what I'm talking about.

2 - 'Let's Build a Simple Interpreter':  
**"If you don’t know how compilers work, then you don’t know**
**how computers work. If you’re not 100% sure whether you**
**know how compilers work, then you don’t know how they work."**  
I too, have no idea of what a interpreter is.  
This might do me some good.

3 - Install Papis:  
**"Papis is a command-line based document and**  
**bibliography manager. Its command-line interface (CLI)**
**is heavily tailored after Git."**   
I, as the world renowned erudite that I am, am in dire need of
something that coaxes some order into my ever expanding,
sprawling collection of electrical tomes.  
I have 15 books in PDF.  
But these things are generally fun to use, and I'm going to
give it a try.

4 - Create a self hosted blog about Linux, Python, and how my
project are going and stuff:   
Yeah, that might be fun.

5 - Get to know SQL Alchemy:  
In my case, get to know anything about SQL Alchemy. I flicked
through the documentation and it seemed, to a very hurried and
unfocused eye, that it could do interesting things.
Must study it with more care.
